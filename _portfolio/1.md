title: "Stock Price prediction with LSTM-RNN | Tools: PySpark, Databricks, AWS"
excerpt: "Designed and implemented a Spark pipeline on AWS using PySpark and Databricks to predict stock prices with 93% accuracy.
Collaborated with a team of students to fine-tune hyperparameters, reducing the model's squared error to 5%.
Utilized Databricks to create scalable data pipelines for real-time data ingestion and pre-processing."
